# backend-furniture

This project is for a startup that is acquiring used furniture from users at a price, refurbishing them and selling them off at a margin. The website must display second-hand furniture that is currently being sold.
Features
- Users must be able to sign up on the site and set up their profile.
- Users must be able to search for their required products and checkout to the payment page.
- Once payment is successful, the expected time of product arrival must be communicated to the user via email as well as displayed on the order page.
- Users must also be able to sell used furniture to the company.
- Users must be able to upload pictures of the items they intend to sell. Based on the images, company admins must be able to decide whether to buy or not.
